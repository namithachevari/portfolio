                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I am born and raised in India and for my Bachelors, I decided to pursue a four-year B.Tech Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Kannur University, Kerala. 
                        During this course of study, I had mandatory computer science and coding subjects within the first two years. 
                        Gradually, I developed an interest in computer and coding-based papers compared to the core electronics-based subjects. 
                        Therefore I made a decision to pursue a computer science-based domain as a career.
                    </p>
                    <p>Soon after my degree in 2016, I took up a job at Position2, Bengaluru, where I started 
                        working as a Web development Trainee. Position2 is a fast-growing innovative digital marketing
                        agency that accelerates demand through integrated Content Marketing, Paid Acquisition, and Marketing
                        Technology solutions in India. Headquartered in Santa Clara and founded in 2006, the corporate owns
                        a 200 member team based in Silicon Valley and Bengaluru. I was very passionate about my work at Position2,
                        and I worked with many US clients for website development and maintenance projects. The process of setting up 
                        the project's scope of work, involving in the design and developing phase, developing the website from scratch,
                        working with different in-house teams, debugging the issues, working on Iterations, and finally deploying a 
                        fully optimized website to the end-user always excites me.
